            <div>
                <p>In order to lose fat we must be in an energy deficit (more calories being burned than calories coming
                    in). So lets start by using the macro calculator to figure out our caloric and macro starting point
                </p>
                <div id="calculator">*macro calculator here*</div>
                <p>Now that we have our starting point lets talk about tracking. Every day you will need to meet the
                    macro goals given to you by the calculator (there is a small margin of error that is allowed so
                    don’t worry if you aren’t perfect to the gram just get as close as you can). Now we need to chose a
                    weigh in day. This is one day every week that we weigh ourselves as soon as we wake up after we use
                    the toilet. Pick a day that you wake up at the same time each week and weigh with as little clothing
                    as possible to avoid any inconsistencies. Alternatively, you can weigh everyday and at the end of
                    the week take the average of those weigh ins if you prefer that. Just remember to use the same
                    recommendations as above.

                <h3>Adjusting</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Each week our goal is .5 - 2 lbs of body weight lost. If for 2 weeks in a row you do not lose weight,
                    or you gain weight we will start by taking 75 grams of carbs away from your macro count. If you
                    don’t lose weight or you gain weight for 2 weeks in a row again we will repeat what we did above.
                    Now when it happens from here on out we will alternate between taking away 75 grams of carbs one
                    time and then adding 5 minutes of low intensity cardio 2x per week.

                    As we get down lower in weight we may start to run out of carbs in our diet. While you can take away
                    all your carb source from your diet if you want to I prefer to leave in 150 grams of carbs before we
                    start taking away from other micro nutrient sources.

                    Once your carbs have been depleted you will remove 300 calories from either fat or protein sources
                    in place of removing carbs.

                    *NOTE: do not remove fats to go below half a gram per pound of bodyweight (ex: a 200lb person
                    shouldn’t let their fat intake duck below 100grams) and protein should not go below 1.25 grams per
                    pound of body weight (ex: a 200 lb person should not let their protein intake go below 250grams)

                <h3>How Long Do I Diet For?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>It is important to note that dieting is a stressor for the body both mentally and physically, because
                    of that it is counter productive to stay in a fat loss phase for too long. For each fat loss phase I
                    recommend dieting to lose only 10 percent of your bodyweight max before shifting into a maintenance
                    phase. This maintenance phase should last half the amount of time you dieted for (if you dieted for
                    lets say 14 weeks you should have a maintenance phase for about 7 weeks). After the maintenance
                    phase if you still have more fat you want to lose you will restart the diet phase from where your
                    calories are at the end of maintenance and just start the adjusting process over again.

        <section id="maintenance">
            <div class="title_div">
                <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>When you are ready to start a maintenance phase you will simply increase your daily caloric intake up
                    400 calories (either from carbs, whatever you last cut, or a mix of both), these will be your macros
                    for the start of maintenance. You will also knock off 20 minutes of cardio for the week (doesn’t
                    matter which days). Continue weighing during this time, but don’t change your macros or cardio until
                    4 weeks in. If at week 4 of your maintenance phase your weight starts increasing more than .5 lbs
                    per week, you need to drop your calories slightly (by about 150-300 calories) and if it starts
                    decreasing you need to increase your calories slightly (by about 200-300 calories). The idea here is
                    to keep your weight as stable as possible so that we can give your body a break from the stress of
                    dieting.
