            Content
        </h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            I was first introduced to the gym during my senior year of high school by a few powerlifters that I had the
            pleasure of meeting through my church. I instantly fell in love with fitness. As a 117 pound 18 year old I
            was committed to putting on more size (for what I think would be obvious reasons). I started using
            hypertrophy style training (think bodybuilding style) to make up for the stature God forgot to give me. This
            love for fitness quickly evolved into a love of general health and fitness and I eagerly dove into any
            material I could get my hands on that related to the topic, from nutrition to training principles to
            supplements, to understand the best way to meet my goals. In 2021 my ongoing education binge led me to seek
            out a more structured education and that is when I found EXOS and took on their course to become an EXOS
            Performance Specialist. EXOS is a premier sports performance company that, among many other achievements,
            trained 98 of the athletes invited to the 2023 NFL Combine.


            In 2022 I decided I wanted to bring the principles I learned through my EXOS courses and my self study to
            the average Joe/Jane, but in a way that will gently guide people through their first steps of their fitness
            journey. That is what this website will achieve.

            What to eat?
            Lets start with the basics. In order to lose fat or gain muscle we have to know how much to eat. We do this
            by counting what are called macro nutrients, or macros. These consist of fats, protein, and carbs. Each
            persons macros will be different depending on the individual and their goals (fat loss or muscle gain). At
            the beginning of each program there will be a macro calculator that will give you a rough estimate of your
            macro goals. If after the first week you are not seeing changes you want give the program time to balance
            out your calories, like I said everyone is different and this is just a rough starting point.

            So as what as WHAT to eat this program takes an “If It Fits Your Macros” (or IIFYM) approach to dieting,
            also known as flexible dieting, but IIFYM sounds cooler to me. So all that means is you can eat WHATEVER you
            want as long as at the end of the day you are meeting your macro targets. Please be aware while you can eat
            anything doesn’t mean you SHOULD. Remember we are trying to be healthy here so find a good balance between
            foods you enjoy and foods that are healthy.

            What do I need to get started?
            Bodyweight scale - This will be used to do weekly weigh ins and need to be accurate to .2 lbs (or daily, but
            we will talk about that later)

            Food scale/measuring cups - This is used to weight and portion out our food so we know how much of what we
            are eating

            Gym access - While not 100% necessary for the fat loss program on this site it definitely will help.
            However, this is required for anyone doing the muscle building part of the program

            Some way to log your food - For this part many people use popular food tracker apps such as ‘My Fitness Pal’
            but be aware we will NOT be using their calorie or macro suggestions. There is typically a place in these
            apps to input your own calorie and macro goals that you will be taking advantage of if you chose to go that
            route. Another fine option is paper, pencil, and some addition.

        <h3>Fat Loss</h3>
        <p>
            Fat Loss

            In order to lose fat we must be in an energy deficit (more calories being burned than calories coming in).
            So lets start by using the macro calculator to figure out our caloric and macro starting point

            **insert calculator program I made**
            (Please note: for the first 3 weeks it is unlikely the calculator is accurate enough for you to see
            progress. Be patient this is only a starting point and the adjustments will get us on track soon!)

            Now that we have our starting point lets talk about tracking. Every day you will need to meet the macro
            goals given to you by the calculator (there is a small margin of error that is allowed so don’t worry if you
            aren’t perfect to the gram just get as close as you can). Now we need to chose a weigh in day. This is one
            day every week that we weigh ourselves as soon as we wake up after we use the toilet. Pick a day that you
            wake up at the same time each week and weigh with as little clothing as possible to avoid any
            inconsistencies. Alternatively, you can weigh everyday and at the end of the week take the average of those
            weigh ins if you prefer that. Just remember to use the same recommendations as above.

            Adjusting

            Each week our goal is .5 - 2 lbs of body weight lost. If for 2 weeks in a row you do not lose weight, or you
            gain weight we will start by
            Taking 75 grams of carbs away from your macro count.
            If you don’t lose weight or you gain weight for 2 weeks in a row again we will repeat what we did above
            Now when it happens from here on out we will alternate between taking away 75 grams of carbs one time and
            then adding 5 minutes of low intensity cardio 2x per week.
            As we get down lower in weight we may start to run out of carbs in our diet. While you can take away all
            your carb source from your diet if you want to I prefer to leave in 150 grams of carbs before we start
            taking away from other micro nutrient sources.
            Once your carbs have either been depleted you will remove 300 calories from either fat or protein sources in
            place of removing carbs
            *NOTE: do not remove fats to go below half a gram per pound of bodyweight (ex: a 200lb person shouldn’t let
            their fat intake duck below 100grams) and protein should not go below 1.25 grams per pound of body weight
            (ex: a 200 lb person should not let their protein intake go below 250grams)

            How long do I Diet for?

            It is important to note that dieting is a stressor for the body both mentally and physically, because of
            that it is counter productive to stay in a fat loss phase for too long. For each fat loss phase I recommend
            dieting to lose only 10 percent of your bodyweight max before shifting into a maintenance phase. This
            maintenance phase should last anywhere from half the time to the same amount of time you dieted for (if you
            dieted for lets say 14 weeks you should have a maintenance phase for 7-14 weeks). After the maintenance
            phase if you still have more fat you want to lose you will restart the diet phase from where your calories
            are at the end of maintenance and just start the adjusting process over again

            How do I do a maintenance phase?

            When you are ready to start a maintenance phase you will simply increase your daily caloric intake up 400
            calories (either from carbs, whatever you last cut, or a mix of both), these will be your macros for the
            start of maintenance. You will also knock off 20 minutes of cardio for the week (doesn’t matter which days).
            Continue weighing during this time, but don’t change your macros or cardio until 4 weeks in. If at week 4 of
            your maintenance phase your weight starts increasing more that .5 lbs per week you need to drop your
            calories slightly (by about 150-300 calories) and if it starts decreasing you need to increase your calories
            slightly (by about 200-300 calories). The idea here is to keep your weight as stable as possible so that we
            can give your body a break from the stress of dieting.

        <h3>Muscle Building</h3>
        <p>
            MUSCLE GAIN

            In order to build muscle we must be in a caloric surplus (eat more calories than we use throughout the day).
            If you are coming off a fat loss phase keep the calories and macros you have currently. If you are starting
            from scratch use the macro calculator to get an estimate of where to start.

            **insert calculator**

            Now that we have our starting point lets talk about tracking. Every day you will need to meet the macro
            goals given to you by the calculator (there is a small margin of error that is allowed so don’t worry if you
            aren’t perfect to the gram just get as close as you can). Now we need to chose a weigh in day. This is one
            day every week that we weigh ourselves as soon as we wake up after we use the toilet. Pick a day that you
            wake up at the same time each week and weigh with as little clothing as possible to avoid any
            inconsistencies. Alternatively, you can weigh everyday and at the end of the week take the average of those
            weigh ins if you prefer that. Just remember to use the same recommendations as above.

            Adjusting
            Our goal each week is to gain .3 - .6 pounds of weight. If we don’t gain weight for 2 weeks in a row or if
            we lose weight we will start by adding 300 calories to our diet (you can add this as whatever forms of
            macros you want). After this we will alternate from adding calories and removing 20 minutes of low intensity
            cardio twice a week (don’t go below 20 minutes of low intensity cardio 4x a week).

            Weight training
            Unlike a fat loss phase weight training is a non negotiable for muscle building. Below you will find a 4x a
            week weight training program, however you do not have to use this program. You are able to use any weight
            training program you would like, you are also encouraged to customized the below program to fit you and your
            gym better if you chose to use it.

            When do I stop?
            Since a muscle building phase is not a stressor to the body the same way a fat loss phase is a stressor you
            can theoretically stay in this phase for as long as you’d like. As a general loose rule I advise only
            staying in a muscle building phase for about 6 months or till you get to about 15%

            Maintenance
            At the end of Your bulking phase you will keep your calories and cardio the same for at 4-6 weeks before
            moving onto a fat loss phase. However if you are happy with the way you look you can maintain for as long as
            you want just make sure you are adjusting calories if you start losing or gaining weight week to week.
