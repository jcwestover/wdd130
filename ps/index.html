                <p>I was first introduced to the gym during my senior year of high school by a few powerlifters that I
                    had the pleasure of meeting through my church. I instantly fell in love with fitness. As a 117 pound
                    18 year old I was committed to putting on more size (for what I think would be obvious reasons). I
                    started using hypertrophy style training (think bodybuilding style) to make up for the stature God
                    forgot to give me. This love for fitness quickly evolved into a love of general health and fitness
                    and I eagerly dove into any material I could get my hands on that related to the topic, from
                    nutrition to training principles to supplements, to understand the best way to meet my goals. In
                    2021 my ongoing education binge led me to seek out a more structured education and that is when I
                    found EXOS and took on their course to become an EXOS Performance Specialist. EXOS is a premier
                    sports performance company that, among many other achievements, trained 98 of the athletes invited
                    to the 2023 NFL Combine.



                    In 2022 I decided I wanted to bring the principles I learned through my EXOS courses and my self
                    study to the average Joe/Jane, but in a way that will gently guide people through their first steps
                    of their fitness journey. That is what this website will achieve.

                <p>What do I need to get started?



                    Bodyweight scale- This will be used to do weekly weigh ins and need to be accurate to .2 lbs



                    Food scale/measuring cups- This is used to weight and portion out our food so we know how much of
                    what we are eating



                    Gym access- While not 100% necessary for the fat loss program on this site it definitely will help.
                    However, this is required for anyone doing the muscle building part of the program



                    Some way to log your food- For this part many people use popular food tracker apps such as ‘My
                    Fitness Pal’ but be aware we will NOT be using their calorie or macro suggestions. There is
                    typically a place in these apps to input your own calorie and macro goals that you will be taking
                    advantage of if you chose to go that route. Another fine option is paper, pencil, and some addition.



                    What to eat?

                    Lets start with the basics. In order to lose fat or gain muscle we have to know how much to eat. We
                    do this by counting what are called macro nutrients, or macros. These consist of fats, protein, and
                    carbs. Each persons macros will be different depending on the individual and their goals (fat loss
                    or muscle gain). At the beginning of each program there will be a macro calculator that will give
                    you a rough estimate of your macro goals. If after the first week you are not seeing changes you
                    want give the program time to balance out your calories, like I said everyone is different and this
                    is just a rough starting point.



                    So as to WHAT to eat, this program takes an “If It Fits Your Macros” (or IIFYM) approach to dieting,
                    also known as flexible dieting, but IIFYM sounds cooler to me. So all that means is you can eat
                    WHATEVER you want as long as at the end of the day you are meeting your macro targets. Please be
                    aware while you can eat anything doesn’t mean you SHOULD. Remember we are trying to be healthy here
                    so find a good balance between foods you enjoy and foods that are healthy.
