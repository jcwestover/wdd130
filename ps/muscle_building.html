            <div>
                <p>In order to build muscle we must be in a caloric surplus (eat more calories than we use throughout
                    the day). If you are coming off a fat loss phase keep the calories and macros you have currently. If
                    you are starting from scratch use the macro calculator to get an estimate of where to start.
                </p>
                <div id="calculator">*macro calculator here*</div>
                <p>Now that we have our starting point lets talk about tracking. Every day you will need to meet the
                    macro goals given to you by the calculator (there is a small margin of error that is allowed so
                    don’t worry if you aren’t perfect to the gram just get as close as you can). Now we need to chose a
                    weigh in day. This is one day every week that we weigh ourselves as soon as we wake up after we use
                    the toilet. Pick a day that you wake up at the same time each week and weigh with as little clothing
                    as possible to avoid any inconsistencies. Alternatively, you can weigh everyday and at the end of
                    the week take the average of those weigh ins if you prefer that. Just remember to use the same
                    recommendations as above.

            <div>
                <p>Our goal each week is to gain .3 - .6 pounds of weight. If we don’t gain weight for 2 weeks in a row
                    or if we lose weight we will start by adding 300 calories to our diet (you can add this as whatever
                    forms of macros you want). After this we will alternate from adding calories and removing 20 minutes
                    of low intensity cardio twice a week (don’t go below 20 minutes of low intensity cardio 4x a week).

                <p>Since a muscle building phase is not a stressor to the body the same way a fat loss phase is, you can
                    theoretically stay in this phase for as long as you’d like. As a general loose rule I advise only
                    staying in a muscle building phase for about 6 months or till you get to about 15%

            <div>
                <p>At the end of your bulking phase you will keep your calories and cardio the same for at least 4-6
                    weeks before moving onto a fat loss phase. However, if you are happy with the way you look you can
                    maintain for as long as you want, just make sure you are adjusting calories if you start losing or
                    gaining weight week to week.
